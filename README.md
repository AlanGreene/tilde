Tilde: ~ is where the â™¥ is

Various configuration files ("dot files") and scripts from my home directory. I
use this on new computers so I feel more at home.

To install, execute:
    `git clone https://github.com/janmoesen/tilde.git && tilde/install.sh`

To update an existing install, go to Tilde's directory and execute:
    `git pull && ./install.sh`
